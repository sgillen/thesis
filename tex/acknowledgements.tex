First and foremost I would like to acknowledge my advisor, Katie Byl. She welcomed me into her lab and offered me the guidance to get started, and the freedom to work on what interested me. I would also like to extend my thanks to the rest of my committee, Joao Hespanha, Linda Petzold, and Yon Vissel, for all of their feedback and support.

I would also like to thank the other members of the UCSB robotics lab that I had the privilege of working beside. Guillaume Bellegarda, Nihar Talele, Asutay Ozmen, Thomas Ibbetson, Roman Aguillera, Sean Anderson, and Chris Cheny. Guillaume and Nihar in particular were the senior members of the lab when I first started, and they offered invaluable guidance. In addition to this I would like to acknowledge the visiting students that I had to privilege to work with and mentor, Marco Molnar, Nina Grabka, and Min Dai. 

I also need to thank all of my friends that supported me throughout this time. My old friends: Fraser Hood, Haris Godil, Colin Briber and Holden Smith, and Stephanie Dang, and the many new friends during my time in this PhD program: Nathan Tucker, Rahul Chandan, Michael Choquer, Chris Salls, Chani Jindal, Bryce Ferguson, Brain Canty, Sharad Shankar \todo {anyone else?}. 

My Mother, Father, and Brother Kyle all also need thanks for their unending support and care. 

Lastly I will thank my partner, Jennifer Chan, for just being a great person.
