Deep learning is a very powerful tool for solving all sorts of problems. It however also has many severe drawbacks that hinder it's adoption to the real world. I use knowledge won from other fields to try to attack some of these shortcomings. At times it even appears to be working (if you squint ... generously). I used deep learning to learn to switch between a model based linear controller and a learned controller, and found an application of differentialble physics simulators to the same problem. I then wrote three paper on using post processing to improve reinforcement learning processes. I think the last one was simpler but more important. I wrote a lot of code too, and shared some of it ...

(I also took 2 years of classes, earned a masters degree
and taught for probably another two years combined, including lots of high level classes that I had never taken.
Plus mild server admin stuff
Plus lots of failed ML projects (but now have some ML creds)
Did a freelance software, made some money
Played lots of video games
Wrote lots and lots of code learned several programming languages
Published 5 papers in top conferences
Participation trophy in open source software 
I ended one long term relationship and started another (good decision)
Made many new friends
Got into backpacking (Iceland, peru, georgia), and hiked all over SB
Survived a pandemic
Humbled Myself
